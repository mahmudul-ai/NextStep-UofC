Start early - Begin applying 6-8 months before you want to start\n2. Quality over quantity - Tailor your resume and cover letter for each application\n3. Build a portfolio - Having projects to showcase your skills makes a huge difference\n4. Practice technical interviews - Sites like LeetCode and HackerRank are invaluable\n5. Network - Attend career fairs and reach out to alumni from your school\n\nHope this helps other students who are navigating the internship search process!",
